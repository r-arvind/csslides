# present.js

A fully customizable HTML presentation framework

# Usage

The framework has three core files, the javascript(present.js) and the css for slide styling(present.css) and a css file for transition.

Just include these two in your html file and you can start making presentation.

* Create `div` with a `classname` 'everything'. All the slides will be inside this class.
* To create a slide, create a `div` as `layer <number>` where the number is the slide number. For example: 'layer one', 'layer two' etc.

* Whatever you write within this div will be displayed as a slide.

* You have complete control over the slide. You can write whatever you want however you want.

* You can choose to use the default styling or make your own css rules to style the slide.

* Automatically center contents to the center of the slide by wrapping it in a div called vertical-center

* present.js has 6 set of themes and 6 set of transitions made with css
